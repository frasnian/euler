    <br/>The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.
    <p>What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?</p>

<div id="ezero_solution">
All this problem really needs is a basic function to figure out the largest prime factor.  As with Problem 2, the problem essentially describes the solution.
<p>
I used a simple (and common) method of sucessive division to test candidate divisors - by
sccessively dividing by smaller candidate numbers, larger multiples of those numbers (which will
by definition be non-prime) will be eliminated as we increment our candidate number. It costs 
an extra division for each non-prime we've already tested a divisor of, but this is more than 
offset by skipping the cost of trying to test each candidate divisor for primality. It also has 
the advantage of simplicity. I certainly didn't think of this method first (no idea where I 
first saw it) - if you know of a method that is faster, simpler and cleaner, please let me know.
</p>
<p>For the zero-runtime version, the C++14 relaxations on constexpr functions are used. The code is exactly the same for both the calc-at-execution and zero-runtime implementations - the CAX version just hides constexpr.with a #define directive (hiding a keyword with the preprocessor is extremely bad practice, but this isn't a real program).</p>
