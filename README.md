# Euler Zero
Solutions to Project Euler problems in C++, with a goal of zero-runtime execution speed for each one.

The wiki page at https://github.com/frasnian/euler-zero/wiki has details about this repo, docs and the approach to individual problems.

For the definition of zero-runtime as used by this project, see https://github.com/frasnian/euler-zero/wiki/Background-&-Introduction.

Contact for this repository is euler_zero AT yahoo DOT com.

If you find bugs, have any comments, suggestions about how the documentation can be improved, etc., please drop me an email.

**Please** do not send me your solution to a problem that does not already have a solution in this repository: I will ignore them (it kind of defeats the entire purpose, right?). On the other hand, if I've already worked out a solution, I'd love to see your implementation - especially if it has really good performance numbers for a calculation-at-execution version. It's always cool to see a different approach to the same problem.
