# Euler Zero
Solutions to Project Euler problems in C++, with a goal of zero-runtime execution speed for each one.

The wiki page at https://github.com/frasnian/euler-zero/wiki has details about this repo and (in some cases) the approach I had to individual problems.

The Project Euler home page is at https://projecteuler.net/.
