<h1>Euler Zero - FAQs</h1>
<p>
Okay, I haven&apos;t really gotten "frequent" questions from random github people yet, 
but I&apos;ve <i>definitely</i> gotten a few common ones from friends:
</p>
<p>
Q) Isn&apos;t it wrong to post the solutions?<br/>
A) See <a href="https://github.com/frasnian/euler-zero/wiki/Isn't-it-wrong-to-post-the-solutions%3F" target="_blank">this project wiki page</a>.
</p>
<p>
Q) What&apos;s the point?<br/>
A) There isn&apos;t one. None. Why do you do crossword puzzles or Sudoku on the commuter train on your way to work?
</p>
<p>
Q) You&apos;ve only got a few problems up so far. Why spend all this time on ancillary stuff like documentation and structure?<br/>
A) Well, there are a <i>lot</i> of problems in Project Euler so I&apos;d rather plan ahead. If I keep adding more solutions, I never want to go back and re-do anything for something that is anything but a serious project. Spending the time now, when there are only a few solutions up, means that any issues that come up now occur when the entire project is still manageable and that I have to spend almost no time on this kind of stuff later. Also, if you know me you know that I&apos;m a bit OCD when it comes to project organization. That&apos;s just how I roll.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Q) Do you actually find this fun, or is there something wrong with you?<br/>
A) Yes.
